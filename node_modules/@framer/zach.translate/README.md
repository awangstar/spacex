# Translate your text

This component helps you test your designs in other languages. It's a simple text layer that uses the Google Translate API to convert your strings into Russian, Japanes, or German. After ~20 uses, Google will rate limit your IP address and you'll need to go to the Google Cloud Console and generate an API Key. Google gives new users $300 of free credit which will cover the translation of ~10,000,000 lines of text.

Give it a try and let me know what you think on Twitter --> [@zach__johnston](https://twitter.com/zach__johnston)

## Usage

Drag the text layer into your design and enter the text into the first field. It doesn't work exactly like a text field (bummer) but I've tried to mimick the property panel as closely as possible. 

## API Key

Once you hit the limit of free API calls, you'll need to follow [these steps to get your own Google Cloud API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key). If you have trouble, hit me up and I'll share my API Key with you.
